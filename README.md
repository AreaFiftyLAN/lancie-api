## Contributing
If you want to contribute, awesome! First, pick an issue and self-assign it. Make your changes in a new branch with 
this naming convention: 

> git checkout -b "fb-master_feature-i-want-to-implement"

* **fb** = *Feature branch*
* **master** = *The branch I want to merge in.*
* **feature-i-want-to-implement** = *A short description of the changes in this branch.*

Once you're satisfied with your changes, create a pull request and give it the label "Ready for merge". You can assign someone in specific or wait for someone to pick it up.
