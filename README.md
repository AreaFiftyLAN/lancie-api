# LANcie API
This is the repository for the LANcie-API. The LANcie-API handles everything from registering users to buying tickets and reserving a seat. You can use your own front-end to interact with the API, but you can also use the [LANcie frontend](https://github.com/AreaFiftyLAN/lancie-frontend).

## lancie-api
The API is a Spring based application to suit the needs of a LAN-party.

### Tools
-   [PostgresQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
-   [Mailcatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/). Creates a mailserver locally on your pc. Mailcatcher catches all mail sent from the API and displays them in a web interface. Unix-like systems: `gem install mailcatcher`. Windows users can try mailcatcher as well, but [Papercut](https://github.com/changemakerstudios/papercut) has an easier installation. 
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com). Can be used as an alternative to postgresql.

### Docker
The postgres install can be quite a hassle, docker can also be used for this. After docker is installed, create a postgres container: `docker run --name lancie_postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres`. Connect to the running container with `docker exec -tiu postgres lancie_postgres psql` and create a new database with `CREATE DATABASE lancie-dev;`. This is everything you need to initially start the LANcie-API, if, at any later point, you need to connect to the database, you can enter `docker exec -tiu postgres lancie_postgres psql -d lancie-dev`. The next time you want to start developing, a `docker start lancie_postgres` is enough. To stop the container again, `docker stop lancie_postgres` will do.

### Run
1.  Import the project into IntelliJ IDEA, we really recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), since it includes all the support for Spring. You could use another IDE, but we do not recommend this
2.  Make sure you have installed the `Lombok Plugin`
3.  Enable annotation processing, this can be enabled in `Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors`. Here you have to check the checkmark that says `Enable Annotation Processors`
4.  Copy `config/application.properties.sample` to `config/application.properties`. The sample properties assume a working PostgreSQL installation running in the background.

  You should fill in:
  - `spring.datasource.[â€¦]` (`url`, `username`, `password`) to your database url and credentials
  - `a5l.molliekey` and `a5l.googleMapsAPIkey` to their respective keys if you have those

5.  Right click the `Application` class (`src -> main -> java -> ch.wisv.areafiftylan`) and choose `Run`. Terminate the process (you don't have to wait for it to finish starting). Now go to the Run/Debug Configuration window `Run -> Edit Configurations` choose the `Spring Boot` configuration called `Application`. Enable the dev profile for this configuration by entering `dev` in the `Active Profiles` box.

### Run from terminal
It is also possible to start the API directly from the terminal, completely ommitting the IDE. This can be done by running the `./gradlew bootRunDev` command.

## Deploy
If you want to run the API on your server, you probably don't want to run it from the IDE.

### Build
To generate a runnable JAR file, make sure that you have followed all the instructions under the **run** section. When you have done so, run `./gradlew build`. This command will run all tests, and create a runnable JAR file in the `./build` folder. You could also run `Build` from the gradle view in IntelliJ IDEA.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, awesome! First, pick an issue and self-assign it. Make your changes in a new branch, with the following naming convention:

* Fixing a bug? > "**fix**-description\_of\_bug"
* Implementing a new feature? > "**feature**-description\_of\_feature"

Once you're satisfied with your changes, create a pull request and give it the label "Ready for merge". You can assign someone in specific or wait for someone to pick it up. Make sure to include tests and documentation. If Travis isn't happy, we're not happy.
